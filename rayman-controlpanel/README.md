# Rayman Control Panel™ (Metro)
Rayman Control Panel™ is an open source community project created by RayCarrot.
The purpose of this program is to unify existing game patches and fixes, as well as allowing extended configuration, for all PC Rayman games.
This program does not come with any games and requires the user to have them installed.
For certain games it is possible installing them through the program using a game disc.

Main features:
* Support for launching all installed Rayman PC games
* Extended game configuration support
* Game utilities, such as allowing per-level soundtrack in Rayman 1
* Save data backup/restore tool
* Disc installers to install select games from discs
* General utilities, such as the Archive Explorer to modify archive files (.cnt, .ipk etc.)
